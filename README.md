# WaterVR
This is a test of using fluid simulation in Blender, for use in Unity VR games and experiences.
Each frame of the animation is exported as an 'obj' file. This is then imported into Unity and cycled using a script.
See '/Unity/Assets/Animation/AnimateObjs.cs'.

The fluid simulation was done using FLIP Fluids (https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids)
